In this lab, you will use SparkML in IBM Data Science Experience to run generated travel data through a machine learning algorithm, automatically tune the algorithm, and load the data into a DB2 Warehouse database.

## Objectives:
Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:


1. Connect to a database and read data used for machine learning.
2. Identify labels and transform data.
3. Conduct feature engineering for algorithm data.
4. Declare a machine learning model.
5. Setup the Pipeline for data transofms and training.
6. Train the data.
7. Show and evaluate machine learning results.
8. Automatically tune machine learning results.
9. Score data and load  into a new table in DB2 Warehouse.
