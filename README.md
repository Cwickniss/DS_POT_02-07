# IBM Proof of Technology - Introduction to Data Science using Watson Studio

## Description:



1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) in a Jupyter notebook to create categorical predictions using pyspark and a supervised learning model. The model will be saved into a model repository using Watson Machine Learning APIs. 

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will guide participants in examining an R notebook and Shiny UI in Watson Studio using RStudio. It will rely on the output results from Lab-1.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The third lab will use IBM's Neural Network designer and Experiment builder to build and train a simple Convolutional Neural Network. We will use the well-known MNIST dataset for training, test, and validation [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) - Time permitting there will be three labs to choose from for Lab 4. The first one features Watson Machine Learning, a point and click capability to build a machine learning model and deploy it. The second lab features the SPSS Modeler - a visual programming tool to create a machine learning pipeline. The third lab features the Data Refinery tool a fully managed self-service data preparation facility. 

1. [Lab-5](Lab-5) -
