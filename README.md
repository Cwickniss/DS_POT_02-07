# IBM Proof of Technology - Introduction to Data Science using Watson Studio

## Description:
Watson Studio provides you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively working with data. You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, to ingest streaming data, or to create, train, and deploy machine learning/deep learning models. Watson Studio contains both open source and IBM value-add capabilities to help infuse AI into business to drive innovation. 

Watson Studio is tightly integrated with the Watson Knowledge Catalog. The Watson Knowledge Catalog is a secure enterprise catalog to discover, catalog and govern your data/models with greater efficiency. The catalog is underpinned by a central repository of metadata describing all the information managed by the platform. Users will be able to share data with their colleagues more easily, regardless of what the data is, where it is stored, or how they intend to use it. In this way, the intelligent asset catalog will unlock the value held within that data across user groupsâ€”helping organizations use this key asset to its full potential.

The labs in this workshop will illustrate the myriad features included in Watson Studio, and Watson Knowlege Catalog. lab-1, Lab-2, and Lab-3 need to be completed in order. Subsequent labs are independent. 


1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will demonstrate the features of the Watson Knowledge Catalog

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) in a Jupyter notebook to create categorical predictions using pyspark and a supervised learning model. The model will be saved into a model repository using Watson Machine Learning APIs. 

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The third lab will guide participants in examining an R notebook and Shiny UI in Watson Studio using RStudio. It will rely on the output results from Lab-1 and Lab-2. 

1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) - Neural Network Lab

1. [Lab-5](Lab-5) - SPSS Modeler Lab

1. [Lab-6](Lab-6) - Data Refinery Lab

1. [Lab-7](Lab-7) - Visual Recognition Lab 

1. [Lab-8](Lab-8) - Natural Language Classifier Lab
